# Exploratory Data Analysis With Python and Pandas

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and Pandas. It provides a step-by-step guide to analyzing a dataset and gaining insights through data exploration and visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is `Dataset.txt`. It contains information about customer purchases, including customer ID, age, gender, product category, quantity, and price.

### Dataset Structure

The dataset has the following columns:

- `customer_id`: A unique identifier for each customer.
- `age`: The age of the customer.
- `gender`: The gender of the customer.
- `product_category`: The category of the purchased product.
- `quantity`: The quantity of the purchased product.
- `price`: The price of the purchased product.

### Project Steps

The project follows the following steps:

1. Initial Data Exploration: Read in the data, take a glimpse at a few rows, and calculate summary statistics.
2. Univariate Analysis: Analyze continuous and categorical variables one at a time.
3. Bivariate Analysis: Examine the relationship between two variables at a time.
4. Identify and Handle Duplicate and Missing Data: Find and remove duplicate rows, and replace missing values with appropriate measures.
5. Correlation Analysis: Investigate the correlation between numerical variables in the dataset.
